                Inland water systems are essential to our environment because they are
                vital ecosystems that are biodiverse. However scientists have found that
                monitoring inland water quality through <em>in situ</em> testing can be
                costly, time consuming and spatially limited. In this paper, I present
                in detail, a machine learning algorithm that takes in multispectral
                remote sensing data from the AquaSat data set as input to predict
                optically active water quality parameters as desired output. Several
                data preprocessing steps were performed. A neural network model
                consisting of five layers was implemented taking in the preprocessed
                multispectral data as input. Several water quality parameters that were
                deemed optically active based on their spectral signatures were
                predicted as the output of the neural network model. The parameters are
                Chlorophyll-A, Dissolved Organic Carbon, Total Inorganic Sediment, and
                Total Suspended Sediment. Multiple metrics were used to calculate the
                models performance for each parameter predicted including mean absolute
                error, mean square error, and root mean squared error. The results
                proved to be statistically significantâ€“especially for Chlorophyll-A, and
                Total Inorganic Sediment. However, several steps can be taken to improve
                the performance of the model introduced in this experiment such as
                utilizing more or introducing other machine learning algorithms.
                Monitoring water quality is indeed compulsory to determine trends in the
                fluctuation of aquatic environments and how their nutrient and pollutant
                contents are affected by surrounding human activity. With the
                advancements in technology, remote inland water quality assessment and
                conservation strategies will be available at a fraction of the cost of
                their parallel <em>in situ</em> evaluation. This will lead to effective
                remote sensing capabilities in vast inland aquatic systems, especially
                in communities with limited resources. My experiment shows that the use
                of machine learning is applicable to predict water quality parameters
                using remote sensing data without the need for <em>in situ</em> testing.
