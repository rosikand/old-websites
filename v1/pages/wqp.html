      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Inland water systems are essential to our environment because they are
        vital ecosystems that are biodiverse. However scientists have found that
        monitoring inland water quality through <em>in situ</em> testing can be
        costly, time consuming and spatially limited. In this paper, I present
        in detail, a machine learning algorithm that takes in multispectral
        remote sensing data from the AquaSat data set as input to predict
        optically active water quality parameters as desired output. Several
        data preprocessing steps were performed. A neural network model
        consisting of five layers was implemented taking in the preprocessed
        multispectral data as input. Several water quality parameters that were
        deemed optically active based on their spectral signatures were
        predicted as the output of the neural network model. The parameters are
        Chlorophyll-A, Dissolved Organic Carbon, Total Inorganic Sediment, and
        Total Suspended Sediment. Multiple metrics were used to calculate the
        models performance for each parameter predicted including mean absolute
        error, mean square error, and root mean squared error. The results
        proved to be statistically significantâ€“especially for Chlorophyll-A, and
        Total Inorganic Sediment. However, several steps can be taken to improve
        the performance of the model introduced in this experiment such as
        utilizing more or introducing other machine learning algorithms.
        Monitoring water quality is indeed compulsory to determine trends in the
        fluctuation of aquatic environments and how their nutrient and pollutant
        contents are affected by surrounding human activity. With the
        advancements in technology, remote inland water quality assessment and
        conservation strategies will be available at a fraction of the cost of
        their parallel <em>in situ</em> evaluation. This will lead to effective
        remote sensing capabilities in vast inland aquatic systems, especially
        in communities with limited resources. My experiment shows that the use
        of machine learning is applicable to predict water quality parameters
        using remote sensing data without the need for <em>in situ</em> testing.
