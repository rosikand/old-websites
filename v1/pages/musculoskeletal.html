      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        With over 2.6 billion musculoskeletal related injuries occurring each
        year, the need for trained doctors is extensive–especially in rural
        areas where doctors aren’t always available. This experiment aims to
        test the ability of machine learning algorithms, specifically
        convolutional neural networks, to accurately detect abnormalities in
        musculoskeletal radiographs. The Stanford MURA dataset, consisting of
        14,863 musculoskeletal radiographs, was used as input data. This
        experiment aims not only to evaluate the use of machine learning to
        detect abormalities, but also to decipher which CNN architectures
        perform well for this task. Specifically, four different CNN
        architectures were tested: VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet, and Xception.
        Predictions were made on a test set for each model on new radiographs.
        To show the results and to best compare the architectures, training and
        validation accuracy, training and validation loss, and a confusion
        matrix are shown for each architecture. From each confusion matrix,
        several metrics were calculated including sensitivity, specitivity,
        precision, classification accuracy, F-score, and Matthews correlation
        coefficient (MCC). The results are statistically significant and show
        that CNNs are applicable for detecting abnormalities in musculoskeletal
        radiographs.
