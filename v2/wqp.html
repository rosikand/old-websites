    <p class="abstract-text">
      Inland water systems are essential to our environment because they are
      vital ecosystems that are biodiverse. However scientists have found that
      monitoring inland water quality through <em>in situ</em> testing can be
      costly, time consuming and spatially limited. In this paper, I present
      in detail, a machine learning algorithm that takes in multispectral
      remote sensing data from the AquaSat data set as input to predict
      optically active water quality parameters as desired output. Several
      data preprocessing steps were performed. A neural network model
      consisting of five layers was implemented taking in the preprocessed
      multispectral data as input. Several water quality parameters that were
      deemed optically active based on their spectral signatures were
      predicted as the output of the neural network model. The parameters are
      Chlorophyll-A, Dissolved Organic Carbon, Total Inorganic Sediment, and
      Total Suspended Sediment. Multiple metrics were used to calculate the
      models performance for each parameter predicted including mean absolute
      error, mean square error, and root mean squared error. The results
      proved to be statistically significantâ€“especially for Chlorophyll-A, and
      Total Inorganic Sediment. However, several steps can be taken to improve
      the performance of the model introduced in this experiment such as
      utilizing more or introducing other machine learning algorithms.
      Monitoring water quality is indeed compulsory to determine trends in the
      fluctuation of aquatic environments and how their nutrient and pollutant
      contents are affected by surrounding human activity. With the
      advancements in technology, remote inland water quality assessment and
      conservation strategies will be available at a fraction of the cost of
      their parallel <em>in situ</em> evaluation. This will lead to effective
      remote sensing capabilities in vast inland aquatic systems, especially
      in communities with limited resources. My experiment shows that the use
      of machine learning is applicable to predict water quality parameters
      using remote sensing data without the need for <em>in situ</em> testing.
