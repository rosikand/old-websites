    <h5>Abstract</h5>
    <p class="abstract-text">
      Pleural effusion, an abnormal collection of fluid in the pleural space,
        is the most common presentation of pulmonary disease with over 1.5
        million cases identified per year in the United States alone. Patients
        presenting with symptoms suspicious for an effusion often undergo
        diagnostic chest radiographs to identify the presence of an effusion.
        However, these radiologic studies cannot definitively diagnose whether
        the effusion is a transudate or an exudate. The only current method
        known to accurately differentiate the type of effusion present is to
        perform a thoracentesis–an invasive procedure where the excess fluid is
        drained and then analyzed using Light’s criteria. However, a
        thoracentesis is an inefficient and expensive procedure that may not be
        readily available and can further debilitate critically ill patients,
        often compromising or delaying treatment. Conversely, thoracic
        sonography, a non-invasive modality, has traditionally been used to
        diagnose the presence of a pleural effusion, but radiologists are unable
        to use an ultrasound to accurately identify the type of effusion. This
        dilemma prompted my current research question: is there a predictable
        and reliable method to differentiate between transudative and exudative
        pleural effusions based solely on ultrasound images? To this end, I
        developed EffuseNet, a program that uses deep convolutional neural
        networks trained on ultrasound images and associated labels to
        non-invasively differentiate between transudative and exudative pleural
        effusions. Several models and methods were experimentally performed
        including convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. The
        models used in the experiment were then tested on test data and
        evaluated using several different metrics such as a confusion matrix and
        classification accuracy. Although my program is novel in its
        application, the results were statistically significant. With such
        widespread prevalence of pleural effusions diagnosed annually,
        EffuseNet, the first of its kind, is revolutionary and adds a
        significant benefit to society.
