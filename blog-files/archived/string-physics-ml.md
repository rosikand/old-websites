I am not a physicist. In fact, if you were to plot my skills on a graph with a few fields of study, physics would probably be pretty far from where I am. However, even if you are not a physicist, if you've heard anything about String Theory before, it is almost a guarantee that it will pique your curiosity in some manner. 

Yesterday, I came across a couple of videos on the Theory and I thought I'd give them a watch--though this time I promised to be more attentive than my prior experiences with the difficult concept. 

At it's simplest, String Theory tries to create a unified Theory of Everything which combines Einstein's Theory of General Relativity with the Standard Model that composes Quantum Mechanics. More specifically, at the quantum level, the Standard Model describes three fundamental forces known to mankind: weak nuclear, strong nuclear, and electromagnetism. However, Einstein showed that there exists a fourth force in his Theory of General Relativity: that gravity also exists at the quantum level--a fundamental force which the Standard Model does not describe. So in essence, we know there are four fundamental forces in our universe where we can accurately conglomerate three under a singular model, but fail to encapsulate the fourth (gravity) in that same model. So what is a so-called "Theory of Everything"? A theory that correctly unites the Standard Model with gravity. That is what String Theory attempts to do. 

So you may be wondering, why is String Theory still merely just a conjecture and not some verified truth that we all agree upon and thus, giving us a Theory of Everything? Well, you see, in physics, there exist mainly two branches: theoretical and experimental. Theoretical physicists propose theories in which experimental physicists verify such theories through, well, as the name suggests, experiments. However, to prove such a thing as string theory, we'd need a particle accelerator the size of the solar system. So SLAC (see picture below) isn't going to cut it.

Well actually creating that big a particle accelerator in the first place is not feasible. So what do experimental physicists do instead? Fortunately, similar results are shown in things like black holes which sometimes emit some sort of signal that we can pick up on which tells us what would happen if we did actually have a solar-system spanning particle accelerator. However, such emissions are rare, infeasible to collect, and are not perfect estimations.

So that got me thinking: **can we use machine learning to predict and simulate what would happen in solar-system-sized particle accelerator experiments?** At the moment, with my extremely limited knowledge of theoretical physics, I can't answer this question, but as someone who knows more about machine learning than theoretical physics, that question has come to mind. I don't know. Maybe such a proposition is not knowledgable and lacking serious requirements (which is the probable case). Or maybe there is some substance to it. I myself won't know unless I learn more about higher-level theoretical physics. Until then, I'll leave it at that.
