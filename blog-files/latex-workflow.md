# My Current LaTeX Workflow: Using LaTeX with VS Code

Date: 05/04/2021

## Backstory (for those interested)

I first heard of LaTeX back in high school when I began writing technical reports (lab reports, papers, notes, etc.). Back then, I was using the ever-so-common [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). I absolutely loved the PDF output produced, but I didn't like the difficulty of use (probably everyone's thoughts after using LaTeX for the first time). So, going forward, I mainly used Google Docs or Notion for writing most things (> 90%)  and only used LaTeX through Overleaf for writing things that needed to be formally typeset. Fast forward to this quarter, we are required to use LaTeX in my *CS 103: Mathematical Foundations for Computing* class for our problem set solutions. They gave us a starter template to use and already specified a bunch of commands for us so actually writing the TeX source code wasn't a problem. What was a problem though, was the overall LaTeX setupâ€”namely the relatively slow speed it takes Overleaf to compile and update the document (and such speeds increase with the length of the document it seems). Additionally, Overleaf runs through the web - not natively - so you are trusting Overleaf to keep your files. 

## The solution

**Overall, I needed these features:**

- Fast compile time to PDF output.
- Semi-autocompile (more optional than necessary but good to have).
    - Note: by semi-autocompile I mean either real time live updates when you type (unlikely to find such a thing with LaTeX) or, more realistically, when saving the file.
    - I also recently came across [Texpad](https://www.texpad.com/) which has live preview (so it updates automatically while you type!). 
- Autocomplete.
- Nice editor (smooth, easy on the eye, customizable size of text).
- PDF preview (important, but can be a different application).
- Runs natively (optional)
    - Also, I am not a Linux or Unix maestro by any means so anything that required Linux (i.e. [Gummi](https://gummi.app/)) wasn't going to work. More specifically, I needed something that would work on Mac OS X.

With those requirements, I did some digging: it seems that the best option at the moment is to pair **VS Code + LaTeX** **extensions** with a Mac OS X LaTeX distribution (namely [**MacTex**](https://tug.org/mactex/)). Such a setup is much easier to get started with than most of the other technical setups (i.e. using [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) with [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/)). 

**My current LaTeX workflow is as follows:**

- VS Code as my editor. The extensions that make this work are [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) (which powers most of the stuff, such as the PDF viewer) and [LaTeX language support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=torn4dom4n.latex-support).
- [Mathpix](https://mathpix.com/) for snapping equations from lecture slides and such. Though, you are only offered a limited number of snips unless you pay a monthly subscription fee.
    - Also occasionally use [this](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php).
- [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/) for native language support.
- [Evan Chen's style file](https://github.com/vEnhance/dotfiles/blob/main/texmf/tex/latex/evan/evan.sty) which I use for my notes.

On a good day, this would be the optimal workflow (this is mostly just a note to myself): 
1. Read over lecture slides/textbook before lecture. Take notes on these. Mainly, get the gist of the content and jot down main definitions in notes (this would allow you to focus more on paying attention during the actual lecture instead of writing down these definitions). 
2. Attend lecture, pay attention, and ask questions (or jot down any questions you think of). Asking questions is a key to learning well because it leads you to understanding concepts you didn't know well enough. Fill in your notes. Though this time around, you should focus on writing down thoughts that come to your mind, reflections, embodiments of definitions, etc. rather than rote copying definitions from the board which should have already been in your notes via step 1. 
3. Arguably the most important step: reflect thoroughly on what you learned. Do a five minute pass over your notes and try to summarize the content. Maybe try to think about how you might explain such a topic to a layman unfamilar with the field ([Feynman Technique](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230)). Then, create a list of [atomic](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) flashcard-like questions for the purposes of active recall and spaced repitition (e.g. through [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)). 

## **Future**

- Drawing figures using TikZ, PSTricks, Asymptote, [Xy](https://tug.org/applications/Xy-pic/) (even [typesetting automata](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/a.debray/lecture_notes/using_xy.pdf)!) or [Inkscape](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-2/).
- Pre-defined [snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) like used in [this workflow](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/). 
- Something that will allow me to add images easily.
- Notion or Markdown to LaTeX converter (that actually works for my purposes).
- Writing LaTeX on this blog. 
- Make a machine learning model that has the functionalities of Mathpix.
    - Maybe this can even be extendable to [handwritten math](https://rosikand.github.io/projects/mse/document.html) too!
