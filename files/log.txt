Hello! Welcome to my journal! I will be logging things here informally. More specifically, I plan to occasionally post "Today I learned..." posts. Enjoy!

[2021-04-14 12:00] "Paperlets"
I was reading Scott Aaronson's blog and came across the notion of "Paperlets"--informal unpublished/not fully written research papers. Read more [here](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1902).

[2021-04-14 12:00] On using pseudonyms
I recently came across [this](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/71018) Stack Exchange post which I found interesting. More specifically, that answer proposed a way in which one can use cryptography to later prove something they wrote pseudonymously.

[2021-04-30 12:00] Quote of the month

This tweet really resonated with me because my interests span a broad spectrum and made me realize that I should focus on specific niche interests rather than many to optimize impact.
